# Contribute to IBM Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit

IBM Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit is an open-source project. We appreciate
your interest and efforts to contribute.

All efforts to contribute are highly appreciated: we encourage revising the
existing list of [`issues`] or start a new issue before starting the
implementation of a new pull request as the main way of communicating with
the project maintainers.

## Open Development & Community Driven

`aihwkit` is open-source under the [Apache License 2.0]. All the work
done is available on GitHub, and the resulting Python packages are available
in PyPI.

We strive to follow a pull request based workflow both for contributions
from the core team and contributions:

1. Comment on an existing issue or start a new one for a high level discussion
   about the feature or bug to fix.

   > This is the preferred way of starting a conversation and gather feedback
   > about the proposed changes, and get in touch with the maintainers or other
   > users that might be interested in the feature.

2. Create a new branch in your fork for starting the implementation.

   > By starting your work in a branch, it's easier to keep your fork synced
   > with the latest changes and has a number of practical benefits. You can
   > find out more about creating a fork and how to start a branch in the
   > [GitHub documentation].

3. Work on your contribution at your own pace and preference.

   > Hack away! This is the part where the initial implementation takes place.
   > In order to ensure that the changes work as expected, we have a number of
   > helper tools and tests that you can make use of while developing.

4. Include tests along with your changes.

   > Tests help ensuring that the new features are working as intended - and
   > that other contributors have confidence when modifying existing features.
   > Please ensure to add tests that exercise the new functionality adequately.

5. Create your pull request based on you branch.

   > Once you are happy with your changes, opening a pull request is the way
   > to propose your contribution to the project and have direct feedback about
   > the implementation.

6. Follow up on the code review and feedback on your pull request.

   > After the pull request is submitted, the maintainers will review your
   > contribution. This is a two-way conversation as well, with mutual feedback
   > and help in the hopes of getting the contribution ready to
   > be merged.

7. Merging your contribution into the project.

   > Success! Once the pull request is completed, it will be merged into the
   > project and be part of the next release.
