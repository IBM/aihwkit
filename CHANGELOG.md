## [UNRELEASED]

### Added

* Added more types of resistive devices: `IdealResistiveDevice`, `LinearStep`,
  `SoftBounds`, `ExpStep`, `VectorUnitCell`, `TransferUnitCell`,
  `DifferenceUnitCell`. (\#14)

### Changed

* Specifying the tile configuration (resistive device and the rest of the
  properties) is now based on a new `RPUConfig` family of classes, that is
  passed as a `rpu_config` argument instead of `resistive_device` to `Tiles`
  and `Layers`. Please check the `aihwkit.simulator.config` module for more
  details. (\#23)
