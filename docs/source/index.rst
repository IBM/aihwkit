*IBM Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit* is an open source Python toolkit for
exploring and using the capabilities of in-memory computing devices in the
context of artificial intelligence.

Components
----------

The toolkit consists of two main components:

PyTorch integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A series of primitives and features that allow using the toolkit within PyTorch:

* Analog neural network modules (fully connected layer, 1d/2d/3d convolution
  layers, sequential container).
* Analog training using torch training workflow:

  * Analog torch optimizers (SGD).
  * Analog in-situ training using customizable device models and algorithms
    (Tiki-Taka).
* Analog inference using torch inference workflow:

  * State-of-the-art statistical model of a phase-change memory (PCM) array
    calibrated on hardware measurements from a 1 million PCM devices chip.
  * Hardware-aware training with hardware non-idealities and noise included
    in the forward pass.

Analog devices simulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A high-performant (CUDA-capable) C++ simulator that allows for
simulating a wide range of analog devices and crossbar configurations
by using abstract functional models of material characteristics with
adjustable parameters. Feature include:

* Forward pass output-referred noise and device fluctuations, as well
  as adjustable ADC and DAC discretization and bounds
* Stochastic update pulse trains for rows and columns with finite
  weight update size per pulse coincidence
* Device-to-device systematic variations, cycle-to-cycle noise and
  adjustable asymmetry during analog update
* Adjustable device behavior for exploration of material specifications for
  training and inference
* State-of-the-art dynamic input scaling, bound management, and update
  management schemes

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along with the two main components, the toolkit includes other functionality:

* A library of device presets that are calibrated to real hardware data and
  device presets that are based on models in the literature, along with config
  preset that specify a particular device and optimizer choice.
* A module for executing high-level use cases ("experiments"), such as neural
  network training with minimal code overhead.
* Integration with the `AIHW Composer`_ platform that allows executing
  experiments in the cloud.

.. warning::
    This library is currently in beta and under active development.
    Please be mindful of potential issues and keep an eye for improvements,
    new features and bug fixes in upcoming versions.

Example
-------

::

    from torch import Tensor
    from torch.nn.functional import mse_loss

    from aihwkit.nn import AnalogLinear
    from aihwkit.optim import AnalogSGD

    x = Tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3], [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3]])
    y = Tensor([[1.0, 0.5], [0.7, 0.3]])

    # Define a network using a single Analog layer.
    model = AnalogLinear(4, 2)

    # Use the analog-aware stochastic gradient descent optimizer.
    opt = AnalogSGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
    opt.regroup_param_groups(model)

    # Train the network.
    for epoch in range(10):
        pred = model(x)
        loss = mse_loss(pred, y)
        loss.backward()

        opt.step()
        print('Loss error: {:.16f}'.format(loss))
