We use the fitting utility to create a model of the characterized device and then define an rpu_config, an abstraction used to represent many hardware details of a possible in-memory computing tile that leverages the characterized device. We then use the in-memory computing tile to train a simple network with different training algorithms.\n",

    "## Device characterization and parameter fitting\n",
    "In this notebook scenario, we start from the electrical characterization of novel Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) devices. A typical way of testing the RRAM device targeted for in memory computing application is to provide a series of equal pulses (usually 200) designed to increment the device conductance to its maximum level (G_max) and then a series of equal pulses designed to change the conductance to its minimum value (G_min). The next step is to apply a series of pulses consisting of one pulse aimed at incrementing the conductance followed by a pulse aimed at decrementing the conductance. This last train of pulses has the effect of placing the device in what's called the Symmetry Point (SP) which is the point where the change in conductance (dw^+) caused by an incrementing pulse is equal to the change in conductance (dw^{-}) caused by a decrementing pulse. More details can be found in [Gong et al., IEDM 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019569).\n",

    "We can extract all the needed parameters by using the fitting utility and then use the parameters to customize a general device mode. In the code below we define a general device behavior based on the SoftBoundsDevice model, which best represent the electrical response of the RRAM device under study. Without any noise the pulse response curve (i.e. giving a series of positive pulses and negative pulses) can be visualized as follows:   "

    "We first need to define which kind of optimizer we will be using for training the network. The analog device response curve is usually non-linear and non-symmetric and performs poorly with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. However, SGD has a relative simple rpu_config, and it is also a good baseline to compare against the performance of specialized analog training optimizer (such as the Tiki-Taka algorithm), which we will review later in this notebook.\n",

    "As an example of how one would customize the configuration, we set a non-standard pulse behavior of the update. The UpdateParameters can be used to customize how we set a non-standard pulse behavior of the update. The UpdateParameters can be used to customize how the analog tile delivers the updated pulses to the device to change the conductance states. In this in-memory training example, the crossbar array uses two stochastic bit streams of pulses applied to the row and columns of the device, needing an update, to change its conductance. When the pulses coincide, an update will happen as further explained in [Gokmen & Vlasov, Front. Neurosci. 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00333/full).

    "\n",
    "The accuracy that is achieved by the network using in-memory computing with SGD is low. This is due to the non-idealities of the device used in the cross-point array, which are not accounted for in the standard SGD algorithm. This demonstrates that innovations at the algorithmic level are needed to enable accurate analog in-memory computing.\n",

    "IBM Research is developing new training algorithms which can alleviate the non-idealities of these devices achieving high network accuracy. In this notebook, we explore the Tiki-Taka algorithm which eliminates the stringent symmetry requirement to increase and decrease of device conductance.\n",
    "SGD and Tiki-Taka both use the error backpropagation. Still, they process the gradient information differently and are fundamentally different algorithms. Tiki-Taka replaces each weight matrix W of SGD with two matrices, referred to as matrix A and C. Then, it creates a coupled dynamical system by exchanging information between the two. We showed that in the Tiki-Taka dynamics, the non-symmetric behavior is a valuable and needed property of the device; therefore, it is ideal for many non-symmetric device technologies.\n",
