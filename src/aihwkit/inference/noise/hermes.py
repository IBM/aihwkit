class HermesNoiseModel(BaseNoiseModel):
    r"""A Noise model that was fitted and characterized on the PCM devices of the
    platform IBM HERMES Project Chip, see `Le Gallo et al. Nat. Electronics (2023)`_
    and `Khaddam-Aljameh et al. JSSC (2022)`_

    Expected weight noise at assumed time of inference with expected
    programming noise at 0.

    See also `Nandakumar et al. ICECS (2019)`_ for details about the
    statistical modelling methodology that was used.

    NOTE: The argument `num_devices` changes the programming method and the drift behavior of
    the model. When `num_devices` is 1, a conventional single device programming method is
    used. When `num_devices` is 2, the method from the work `Vasilopoulos et al. TED (2023)`_
    is employed (MSF), which is optimal and yields higher programming accuracy.
    For the drift characterization, though, when `num_devices` is 2 the model is applied as
    if the two devices host the same conductance and not as described in the aforementioned
    reference, due to it using a dynamic conductance mapping step which requires feedback from
    the chip in question. This simplification yields worse drift behavior in the current model
    than the one measured on-chip in the aforementioned work.

    Args:
        prog_coeff: Programming polynomial coeffs in
            :math:`\sum_i c_i \left(\frac{g_t}{g_\max}\right)^i`
        g_converter: instantiated class of the conductance converter
            (defaults to single pair)
        num_devices: The number of devices that are used to map a weight.
            Hermes supports either 1 or 2 devices per weight. When `num_devices`
            is 2, higher programming accuracy and less drift variability is measured.
            Defaults to 2.
        g_max: In :math:`\mu S`, the maximal conductance, ie the value
            the absolute max of the weights will be mapped to.
            When `num_devices = 2`, the maximum characterized conductance
            is 20.7 :math:`\mu S`. When `num_devices = 1` the maximum
            characterized value is 10.35 :math:`\mu S`. When `None` is passed (by default)
            the maximum conductance for the corresponding `num_devices` is selected.
        t_read: Parameter of the 1/f fit (in seconds).
        t_0: Parameter of the drift fit (first reading time). When `num_devices = 2`
            that time corresponds to 300s, while in the case that `num_devices = 1`
            it is 200s. If `None` is passed (by default) the time is selected according
            to the `num_devices` selection.

            Note:
                The ``t_inference`` is relative to this time `t0`
                e.g. t_inference counts from the completion of the programming
                of a device.
        prog_noise_scale: Scale for the programming noise.
        read_noise_scale: Scale for the read and accumulated noise.
        drift_scale: Scale for the  drift coefficient.
        prog_coeff_g_max_reference: reference :math:`g_\max` value
            when fitting the coefficients, since the result of the
            polynomial fit is given in uS. If
            ``prog_coeff_g_max_reference`` is not given and
            `prog_coeffs` are given explicitly, it will be set to
            ``g_max`` of the conductance converter.
