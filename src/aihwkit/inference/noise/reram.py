class ReRamWan2022NoiseModel(BaseNoiseModel):
    r"""Noise model that was inferred from ReRam publication data.

    This ReRam model is and approximation to the data published by
    `Wan et al. Nature (2022)`_.

    Conductance dependence of the deviations from the target
    conductance was estimated from the published figures and fitted
    with a 4-th order polynomial (only 1 sec, 1 day, 2 day).

    No separate data is available for read noise (1/f).

    Note:

        To account for short-term read noise (about 1\%) one should
        additional set the ``forward.w_noise`` parameter to about 0.01
        (with w_noise_type=WeightNoiseType.ADD_NORMAL)

    Args:

        coeff_dic: polynomial coefficients in :math:`\mu S`,
            :math:`\sum_i c_i \left(\frac{g_t}{g_\max}\right)^i` for
            each time. If not given, the fitted measurement is taken
            at selected time points only

        g_converter: Instantiated class of the conductance converter
            (defaults to single pair).
        g_max: In :math:`\mu S`, the maximal conductance, i.e. the value
            the absolute max of the weights will be mapped to.
        noise_scale: Additional scale for the noise.
        coeff_g_max_reference: reference :math:`g_\max` value
            when fitting the coefficients, since the result of the
            polynomial fit is given in uS. If
            ``coeff_g_max_reference`` is not given and
            `coeffs` are given explicitely, it will be set to
            ``g_max`` of the conductance converter.
