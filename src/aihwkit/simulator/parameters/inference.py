@dataclass
class DriftParameter(SimpleDriftParameter):
    r"""Parameter for a power law drift.

    The drift is based on the model described by `Oh et al (2019)`_.

    It computes:
    .. math::

        w_{ij}*\left(\frac{t + \Delta t}{t_0}\right)^(-\nu^\text{actual}_{ij})

    where the drift coefficient is drawn once at the beginning and
    might depend on device. It also can depend on the actual weight
    value.

    The actual drift coefficient is computed as:
    .. math::

        \nu_{ij}^\text{actual} =  \nu_{ij} - \nu_k \log \frac{(w_{ij} - w_\text{off}) / r_\text{wg}
        + g_\text{off}}{G_0}  + \nu\sigma_\nu\xi

    here :math:`w_{ij}` is the actual weight and `\nu_{ij}` fixed for
    each device given by the mean :math:`\nu` and the device-to-device
    variation: :math:`\nu_{ij} = \nu + \nu_dtod\nu\xi` and are only
    drawn once at the beginning (tile instantiation).  `\xi` is
    Gaussian noise.

    Note:
        If the weight has changed from the last drift call (determined
        by the ``reset_tol`` parameter), for instance due to update,
        decay or noise, then the drift time :math:`t` will be reset and start
        from new, however, the drift coefficients :math:`\nu_{ij}` are
        *not* changed. On the other hand, if the weights has not
        changed since last call, :math:`t` will accumulate the time.

    Caution:
        Note that the drift coefficient does *not* depend on the initially
        programmed weight value at :math:`t=0` in the current
        implementation (ie G0 is a constant for all devices), but
        instead on the actual weight. In some materials (e.g. phase
        changed materials), that might be not accurate.
