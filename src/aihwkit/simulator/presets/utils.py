class PresetIOParameters(IOParameters):
    r"""Preset for the forward and backward pass parameters.

    This defines the default (peripheral) hardware configurations
    used for most presets.

    Currently, we assume 7 bit DAC (without stochastic rounding) and 9
    bit ADC (including the sign) and a fixed dynamic range ratio. The
    dynamic range ratio is defined by how many fully-on inputs would
    saturate the output ADC when all weights are set maximal
    conductances. This value is set to 20 here, as the weight range is
    normalized to :math:`-1,\ldots 1`.

    Moreover, the output noise (additive Gaussian) is set to 0.1,
    which is on the order of 1 LSB of the ADC.

    By default, we turned additional weight noise off, however, some
    presets might turn it on as required by the device specification.

    Finally, we assume by default that the device is run with bound
    management (see
    :class:`~aihwkit.simulator.config.utils.BoundManagementType`) and
    noise management (see
    :class:`~aihwkit.simulator.config.utils.NoiseManagementType`)
    turned on to `ITERATIVE` and `ABS_MAX`, respectively.
