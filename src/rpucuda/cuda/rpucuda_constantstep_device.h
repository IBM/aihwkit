/* ConstantStepRPUDeviceCuda

   Implements the ConstantStep update, that is the step-size per
   pulse (dw) does not depend on the actual weight value (w).

   For smaller noise, we assume that the cycle-to-cycle
   noise times the weight update minimal step (dw) remains
   consistent with the direction of the update. E.g. if the update
   is supposed to be positive, dw + noise is assumed to be positive
   as well.

   If noise setting is too large, so that dw+noise signs changes
   become likely during multiple steps in the same direction, we use
   a slightly slower implementation, where the bounds are checked
   for each weight change.
